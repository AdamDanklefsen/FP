Pipe Flow Design Project

Goal I: Develop a mathematical model

 See Visual Studio Project

Goal II: Identify one physical parameter

 The Parameter I chose had to do with the physical designs themselves and the layout of the network. Design I flows directly from the source to each outlet and runs only during the day. This one is the most simplistic and has the best performance. Design II brings the water from the source to a water tower, and then the water tower distributes to the outlets, using the most pipe and costing much more to run than Design I. Design III differs from Design II by routing the water through shared pipe during the night to the water tower, and letting the water tower supply the network unpowered during the day. This design costs more upfront due to needing larger pipe to get the water up to the water tower and has the same operating cost as Design II.

Goal III: Identify one primary output quantity of interest

 For this, I outputted four different quantities, total head loss, pump work required, pipe cost, and operating cost per day. From this we can arrive at two different quantities; head loss per pump head, and a cost function. I chose to have two output values as opposed to one, as my competition for this contract are only supplying one. Business people care about how much something costs and are impressed by a high efficiency. As for the rational efficiency suggested, I can infer than the Carnot efficiency does not apply here and am unsure of what to use a &quot;Perfect&quot; design for reference. My guess would be to not calculate head loss and take the sum of the output head and divide it by the input head, which I believe would just be one, defeating the purpose.

Goal IV: Write a design statement defining your design selection process

 _The best design is going to be the one that costs the least up front and over time._ Efficiency does not have as much of an effect here, as the power requirement is already factored into the cost. Normally, a water tower would benefit the network, but due to the water source being much lower than the required position of the water tower and the constant load, it does not make much sense here.

Goal V&amp;VI: Preform a sensitivity study and make a plot

 With my design parameter being based around the design as a whole, it is hard to vary continuously. That being said, another physical parameter should have been chosen, such as different pumps/pump configurations, pump placement, or pipe material/size. This was all in the plan but I ran out of time. The code is set up in a way such that varying any parameter could be done before MATLAB would even open.



Additional notes:

 When assigned the project we were told that we could write it in any language of our choosing and I took that as a challenge. I have been following a game programming tutorial series with a very active community that had been teaching me both 2D and 3D graphics, and with my current schedule personal projects are out of the question so I saw this as a good opportunity to utilize what I had been learning. Dr. Rumpfkeil encouraged me to sign up for his AEE 558 CFD class next semester which will involve a lot of mixing fluid dynamics and graphics programming and this project had definitely prepared me for that. As for the last two parts, they are clearly not finished, however, if given the opportunity would be able to complete them and give a fuller report on the matter.
